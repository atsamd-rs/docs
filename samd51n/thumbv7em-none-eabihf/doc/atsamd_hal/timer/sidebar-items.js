window.SIDEBAR_ITEMS = {"struct":[["TimerCounter","A generic hardware timer counter. The counters are exposed in 16-bit mode only. The hardware allows configuring the 8-bit mode and pairing up some instances to run in 32-bit mode, but that functionality is not currently exposed by this hal implementation. TimerCounter implements both the `Periodic` and the `CountDown` embedded_hal timer traits. Before a hardware timer can be used, it must first have a clock configured."]],"trait":[["Count16","This is a helper trait to make it easier to make most of the TimerCounter impl generic.
